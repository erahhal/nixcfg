## @IMPORTANT NOTE: On Hybrid setup:
## - Internal display is driven by intel GPU
## - External display is driven by nvidia GPU
## - Rendering on intel and offloading to nvidia is slow on external monitors, especially high resolution ones.
## - Rendering on nvidia and offloading to intel is slow on laptop monitor, but tolerable
## - SO, make sure window manager is using discrete nvidia GPU to render
